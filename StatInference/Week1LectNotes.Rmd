## Notes from B Caffo week 1 lectures

### Probability

prob'y refers to population, i.e. fundamental property of a die being rolled

3 rules are Kolmogorov's - see LittleInferenceBook, page 7

1) Pr gets a number between 0 and 1

2) Pr if something occurs is 1, if nothing, 0

3) If two events are mutually exclusive, the Pr is the sum of the prob's


Consequences:

1) For any 2 events, the Pr that at least one occurs is the sum of the 2 Pr's minus the intersection
