## Notes from B Caffo week 1 lectures

### Probability Intro

prob'y refers to population, i.e. fundamental property of a die being rolled

3 rules are Kolmogorov's - see LittleInferenceBook, page 7

1) Pr gets a number between 0 and 1

2) Pr if something occurs is 1, if nothing, 0

3) If two events are mutually exclusive, the Pr is the sum of the prob's


Consequences:

1) For any 2 events, the Pr that at least one occurs is the sum of the 2 Pr's minus the intersection



### Probability mass functions - for discrete

Random variable = numerical outcome of an experiment (TB: anything, BMI, a factor, count, whatever)

A PMF evaluated at a value corresponds to the Pr that a random variable takes that value  

A function p that is a PMF must always be >= 0, and the sum of all possible values must = 1

1) $p(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
2) $\sum_{x} p(x) = 1$

    
Most famous PMF: Bernoulli, results of coin flip

$$ p(x) = (1/2)^{x} (1/2)^{1-x} \mbox{ for }x = 0,1 $$ for x = 0,1 of fair coin
    
$$ p(x) = \theta^{x} (1 - \theta)^{1-x} \mbox{ for }x = 0,1 $$ for x = 0,1 of unfair coin
    
    we don't know theta, so we use our data to estimate it



### Probability density functions - for continuous
        
1) Same rule: A function p that is a PDF must always be >= 0, and the total area under the PDF must = 1

2) PDF applies to population, not the data (will use the data to estimate the population PDF)


Proportion of help calls that get addressed in a random day by a help line is 

$$ f(x) = \left{\begin{array}{ll} 2 x & \mbox{ for } 1 > x > 0 \ 0 & \mbox{ otherwise} \end{array} \right. $$

```{r pdf1}
x <- c(-0.5, 0, 1, 1, 1.5); y <- c( 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)
plot(x, y, lwd = 3, frame = FALSE, type = "l")

pbeta(0.75,2,1) ### beta distribution, pbeta gives Pr of being <0.75 from a beta distribution
```


Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of a random variable X returns the Pr that the random variable is <= to the value x (discrete or continuous)

$$ F(x) = P(X \leq x) $$

p[density name] in R returns the CDF (e.g. pbeta)


Survival function is 1 - CDF

$$ S(x) = P(X > x) $$
    



### Quantiles (still in PDF lecture)

$\alpha^{th}$ quantile of a distribution with distribution function $F$ is the point $x_\alpha$ so that 

$$ F(x_\alpha) = \alpha $$

qbeta(0.5, 2, 1) ### q[function name] gives population quantiles


### Linking Sample to a Population

estimand = target of estimation = population quantity (e.g. population median)
estimator = quantity in the sample (e.g. sample median)
